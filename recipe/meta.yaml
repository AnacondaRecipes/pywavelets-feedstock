  summary: 'Discrete Wavelet Transforms in Python'
  description: |
    PyWavelets is a free Open Source library for wavelet transforms in Python.
    Wavelets are mathematical basis functions that are localized in both time and frequency.
    Wavelet transforms are time-frequency transforms employing wavelets. They are similar to
    Fourier transforms, the difference being that Fourier transforms are localized only in
    frequency instead of in time and frequency.
